# Intro to React Workshop

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and uses [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for a quick base set of styles and components.

This project is intended to help developers that have been working with React for a while already to learn some more advanced techniques and patterns for building extensible components for use by any number of consumers. It's also intended to help you conceive of different use cases for React component wrappers than you might otherwise consider, and demonstrate just how easily you can declaratively tie in a variety of services and data needs the way you would drop in any other component, and allow as much flexibility as possible for your consumers.

To get up and running quickly, simply follow these steps:

### Fork the repository

### Clone the repository

Visit your own copy of this repository and click the green `Clone or download` button to display the clone path. Copy this to your clipboard, then use your utility of choice (terminal, Sourcetree, etc.) to clone the repository to your desired location on disk.

### Install dependencies

From within the root of the project directory, run `yarn` or `npm install` to install the project dependencies.

### Run the project

From within the root of the project directory, run `yarn start` or `npm start` to run the application. It should automatically launch your browser to the right location, but if it doesn't, you can just open a page to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
